# Python Code Repository üêç

Welcome to the Python Code Repository! This repository includes various Python scripts designed for specific tasks and analytical challenges. Explore, use, and contribute as you wish.

## Task 1: Find the Maximum Number in a List

**File:** `numberList.py`

**Description:** This script generates a list of 20 random integers between 1 and 100. It then finds and displays the largest number in the list.

## Task 2: Check Palindrome

**File:** `palindrome.py`

**Description:** This Python algorithm checks if a given word "X" is a palindrome. It prints "Yes, the word X is a palindrome" if affirmative, and "No, the word X is not a palindrome" otherwise.

## Task 3: Sum of Odds from CSV

**File:** `sumOfOdds.py`

**Description:** Reads a CSV file named "numeros.csv" containing integers separated by commas. The script calculates and returns the sum of the odd numbers in the file.

## Analytical Tasks using Crash_Data.xlsx

**Description:** Utilizes the "Crash_Data.xlsx" dataset, which provides details on traffic fatalities in Australia. The following analytical tasks are performed:

### Analytical Task 1: Average Age by Gender in 2021

**File:** `deathByAgeAverage.py`

Calculates the average age of individuals who died in traffic accidents in Australia in 2021, based on gender.

```csv
| Gender | Age   |
|--------|-------|
| Female | 49.75 |
| Male   | 42.74 |
```

### Analytical Task 2: Age Group Representativity by Crash Type

**File:** `representativityByAge.py`

Analyzes the representativity of age groups concerning different crash types. The results are saved to a CSV file.

```csv
| Age Group   | Crash Type | Count | Representativity |
|-------------|------------|-------|------------------|
| 0_to_16     | Multiple   | 1703  | 7.23%            |
| 0_to_16     | Single     | 2377  | 8.14%            |
| 17_to_25    | Multiple   | 5359  | 22.76%           |
| 17_to_25    | Single     | 8412  | 28.80%           |
| 26_to_39    | Multiple   | 5358  | 22.75%           |
| 26_to_39    | Single     | 7006  | 23.99%           |
| 40_to_64    | Multiple   | 6562  | 27.87%           |
| 40_to_64    | Single     | 6853  | 23.47%           |
| 65_to_74    | Multiple   | 2064  | 8.77%            |
| 65_to_74    | Single     | 1949  | 6.67%            |
| 75_or_older | Multiple   | 2502  | 10.63%           |
